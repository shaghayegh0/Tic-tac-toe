# Tic-tac-toe

- This is a simple implementation of the classic X-O (Tic-Tac-Toe) game in Python using the Pygame library. The game allows two players to take turns selecting letters from the alphabet and trying to form a sequence of their chosen letter in a 3x3 grid.

# How to Play
- Players take turns choosing a letter from the alphabet (excluding 'x' and 'o') to place it on the game board.
- The first player to form a sequence of their chosen letter in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- The game ends in a draw if all available letters are used, and no player has won.

# Features
- Randomized initial game board.
- Input validation to ensure players choose valid letters.
- Checks for winning conditions and draws.
- Option to restart the game after it ends.
